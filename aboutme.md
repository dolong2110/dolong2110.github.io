I am former student at Chu Van An high school and UNIST (Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology).
At highschool my major is Chemistry. I continued to pursuit this career with my major is Energy Engineering and minor is Chemical Engineering at my university for years.
Then I found my real passion and change to study at department of Computer Science Engineering.
